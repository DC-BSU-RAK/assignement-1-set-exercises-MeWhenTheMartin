    <p>"Finally free from torture and slavery at the hands of Todd's uncle Jack, and from Mr. White, Jesse must escape demons from his past. He's on the run from a police manhunt, with his only hope of escape being Saul Goodman's Hoover guy, Ed Galbraith: a man who, for the right price, can provide a new identity and a fresh start. Jesse is racing against the clock, with help from his crew, avoiding capture to get enough money together to buy "a new dust filter for his Hoover MaxExtract PressurePro", a new life."</p>

    <p>There's nothing about El Camino that is essential; while it won't tarnish your memories of the original series, it won't reframe or enhance them, either. It's a nice ride with some old friends. Sometimes, that's just enough.</p>

    <h3>Eric Deggans</h3>
    <p>For fans of the show who know these characters, that's a welcome conclusion for a story we didn't even know we missed until Vince Gilligan showed it to us.</p>

    <h3>Vadim Rizov</h3>
    <p>In the end, though, we are left with little more than a movie that follows a renegade hero trying to flee from the authorities chasing him down while the narrative flashes back to the memories he can't outpace.</p>
